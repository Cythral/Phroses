# Phroses [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cythral/phroses.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cythral/phroses)
Phroses is a multi-site content management system and dispatcher. Phroses is easy to use, and extensible with customizable themes using [phyrex](https://github.com/cythral/phyrex) templating, along with plugins using [listen](https://github.com/cythral/listen).  Phroses has only been tested on apache, support for nginx is coming later on. 

## Installation
See the [Installation wiki page](https://github.com/cythral/phroses/wiki/Installation). 

## Usage
To edit, create, or delete a page, just go to the desired URL and use the buttons that appear at the bottom.  Pages can also be managed at /admin/pages.  Site creation is just as easy, just go to the URL and Phroses will ask you to create it.  Manage site credentials at /admin/creds.  Change the site theme and see view count totals on /admin.  Onsite theme and plugin manager coming soon.

## Changes
